This is a **PyTorch tutorial to Image Captioning**.

This is the first of a series of tutorials I plan to write about _implementing_ cool models on your own with the amazing PyTorch library.

Basic knowledge of PyTorch, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, loss functions is assumed.

Questions, suggestions, or corrections can be posted as issues.

# Objective

**To build a model that can generate a descriptive caption for an image we provide it.**

In the interest of keeping things simple, let's choose to implement the [_Show, Attend, and Tell_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) paper. This is by no means the current state-of-the-art, but is still pretty darn amazing.

This model learns _where_ to look. 

As you generate a caption, word by word, you can see the the model's gaze shifting across the image. 

This is possible because of its _Attention_ mechanism, which allows it to focus on the part of the image most relevant to the word it is going to utter next. 

Here are some captions generated on _test_ images not seen during training or validation:

Notice how the model is looking at the boats when it says `boats`, and the sand when it says `the beach`.

# Concepts

* **Image captioning**. You will learn the elements of captioning models, how they work, and how to implement them.

* **Encoder-Decoder architecture**. Any model that generates a sequence will use an encoder to encode the input into a fixed form, and a decoder to decode it, word by word, into a sequence.

* **Attention**. Ilya Sutskever, the research director at OpenAI, [has said](https://www.re-work.co/blog/deep-learning-ilya-sutskever-google-openai) attention will play a very important role in the future of deep learning. If you're not too sure what "attention" really means, just know for now that it's how our image captioning model will _pay attention_ to the important regions of the image. The cool part is the same attention mechanism you see used here is employed in other tasks, usually in sequence-to-sequence models like machine translation.

* **Transfer Learning** and fine-tuning. Transfer learning is when you use parts of another model that has already been trained on a different or similar task. You're transferring the knowledge that has been learned elsewhere to your current task. This is almost always better than training your model from scratch (i.e., knowing nothing). You can also fine-tune this second-hand knowledge to the task at hand if you wish to improve your overall performance.

* **Beam Search**. This is a much better way to construct the caption/sequence from the decoder's output than to just choose the words with the highest scores.

# Overview

A broad overview of the model.

### Encoder

The encoder **encodes the input image with 3 color channels into a smaller image with _learned_ channels**.

This smaller encoded image contains all the useful information we need to generate a caption. Think of it as a summary representation of the original image.

Since we want to encode images, we use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

But we don't need to train an encoder from scratch. Why? Because there are already CNNs trained to represent all that's useful in an image. For years, people have been building models that are extraordinarily good at classifying an image into one of a thousand categories. It stands to reason that these models capture the essence of an image very well.

I have chosen to use the **101 layered Residual Network trained on the ImageNet classification task**, which is already available in PyTorch. This is an example of __transfer learning__.

![ResNet Encoder](./img/encoder.png)
<p align="center">
  *ResNet-101 Encoder*
</p>

These models progressively create smaller and smaller representations of the original image, and each subsequent representation is more "learned" with a greater number of channels. The **final encoding produced by our ResNet-101 encoder has a size of 14x14 with 4096 channels**, i.e., a 4096x14x14 size tensor.

Feel free to experiment with other pretrained architectures. Modifications are necessary. Since the last layer or two of these models are linear layers coupled with Softmax activation for classification, we strip these away.

### Decoder

The decoder's job is to **look at the encoded image and generate a caption word by word**.

Since it is generating a sequence, it would need to be a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. We will use the LSTM flavor of RNNs.

In a typical setting without Attention, you could take the simple average of the encoded image across all pixels. You could then feed this into a decoder LSTM, with or without a linear transformation, as its first hidden state and generate a caption word by word. Each predicted word is fed into the RNN to generate the next word.

![Decoder without Attention](./img/decoder_no_att.png)
<p align="center">
  *Decoding without Attention*
</p>

In a setting _with_ Attention, we want to look at _different_ parts of the image at different points in generating the sequence. For example, while generating the word `football` `in` `a` `man` `holds` `a` `football`, the decoder would know to _look_ at the hat part of the image. It's discarding the less useful parts of the image.

![Decoding with Attention](./img/decoder_att.png)
<p align="center">
  *Decoding with Attention*
</p>

We're using the _weighted_ average across all pixels, with the weights of the important pixels being higher. This weighted average of the image can be concatenated with the previously generated word at each step to generate the next word.

How do we estimate the weights for each pixel? Enter the Attention mechanism...

### Attention

Intuitively, what would you need to estimate the importance of different parts of the image?

You would need to know how much of the sequence you have generated, so you could look at the image and decide what needs describing next. For example, you know that you have mentioned `a man` so far, but you look at the image and notice the aforementioned man is `holding` `a` `football`.

This is exactly what the attention mechanism does - it considers the sequence generated thus far, looks at the image, and _attends_ to the part of it that needs describing next.

![Attention](./img/att.png)
<p align="center">
  *Attention*
</p>

We will use the _soft_ Attention, where the weights of the pixels add up to 1. You could interpret this as finding the probability that a certain pixel is _the_ important part of the image to generate the next word.

### Putting it all together

It might be clear by now what our combined network looks like.

![Putting it all together](./img/model.png)
<p align="center">
  *Encoder + Attention + Decoder*
</p>

- Once the Encoder generates the encoded image, we transform the encoding to create the initial hidden state `h` (and cell state `C`) for the RNN/LSTM Decoder.
- At each decode step,
  - the encoded image and the previous hidden state is used to generate weights for each pixel in the Attention network.
  - the weighted average of the encoding and the previously generated word is fed to the RNN/LSTM Decoder to generate the next word.

### Beam Search

When we generate a word with the Decoder, we are using a linear layer to transform the Decoder's output into a score for each word in the vocabulary.

The straightforward - and quite greedy - option would be to choose the word with the highest score and use it to predict the next word. But this is not optimal because the rest of the sequence hinges on that first word you choose. If that choice isn't the best, everything that follows is sub-optimal. Similarly, the choice of each word in the sequence has consequences for the ones that succeed it.

It might very well happen that if you'd chosen the _third_ best word at that first step, and the _second_ best word at the second step, and so on... _that_ would be the best sequence you could generate.

So, it would be best if we could somehow _not_ decide until we've finished decoding completely, and choose the sequence that has the highest _overall_ score from a basket of candidate sequences.

Beam Search does exactly this:

- At the first decode step, consider the top `k` candidates.
- Generate `k` second words for each of these `k` first words.
- Choose the top `k` [first word, second word] combinations considering additive scores.
- For each of these `k` second words, choose `k` third words, choose the top `k` [first word, second word, third word] combinations.
- Repeat at each decode step.
- After `k` sequences terminate, choose the sequence with the best overall score.

![Beam Search example](./img/beam_search.png)
<p align="center">
  *An illustration of Beam Search with `k`=3.*
</p>

As you can see, some sequences (striked out) may fail early, as they don't make it to the top `k` at the next step. Once `k` sequences (underlined) complete by hitting the `<end>` token, we choose the one with the highest score.

# Implementation

### Dataset

I'm using the MSCOCO '14 Dataset. You need to download the [Training (13GB)](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip) and [Validation (6GB)](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2014.zip) images.

We will use [Andrej Karpathy's training, validation, and test splits](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/caption_datasets.zip). These also contain the captions, already preprocessed. Note that there are also splits and captions for the Flicker8k and Flicker30k datasets, so feel free to use these instead of MSCOCO if the latter is too large for your computer.

### Inputs to model

Before you read this section, I encourage you to think about this on your own. What inputs does our model need to train?

We will need three.

##### Images

The Encoder encodes these images. Since we're using a pretrained Encoder, we would need to first process the images into the form this pretrained Encoder is used to.

Pretrained ImageNet models available as part of PyTorch's `torchvision` module. [This page](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html) details the preprocessing or transform we need to do - pixel values must be in the range [0,1] and we must then normalize the image by the mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet images' RGB channels.

```python
mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
```
Also, PyTorch follows the NCHW convention, which means the channels dimension (C) must precede the size dimensions.

We will resize all MSCOCO images to 256x256 for uniformity.

To summarize, the images fed to the model must be a `Float` tensor of dimension `N, 3, 256, 256`, and must be normalized by the aforesaid mean and standard deviation. `N` is the batch size.

##### Captions

Captions are both the target and the inputs of the Decoder as each word is used to generate the next word.

To generate the first word, however, we need a *zeroth* word, `<start>`.

At the last word, we should predict `<end>` the Decoder must learn to predict the end of a caption. This is necessary because we need to know when to stop decoding during inference.

`<start> a man holds a football <end>`

Since we pass the captions around as fixed size Tensors, we need to pad captions (which are naturally of varying length) to the same length. So we will also use `<pad>` tokens. We choose this fixed length to simply be the length of the longest caption in the corpus.

`<start> a man holds a football <end> <pad> <pad> <pad>....`

Furthermore, we create a `word_map` which is an index mapping for each word in the corpus, including the `<start>`,`<end>`, and `<pad>` tokens. PyTorch, like other libraries, needs words encoded as indices to look up embeddings for them or to identify their place in the predicted word scores.

`9876 1 5 120 1 5406 9877 9878 9878 9878....`

To summarize, the captions fed to the model must be an `Int` tensor of dimension `N, L` where `L` is the padded length.

##### Caption Lengths

Since the captions are padded, we need to keep track of the lengths of each caption. This is actual length + 2 (for the `<start>` and `<end>` pads).

Caption lengths are also important because of PyTorch's dynamic graphs. We only process a sequence upto its length and we don't need to waste any computation over the `<pad>`s.

Caption lengths fed to the model must be an `Int` tensor of dimension `N`.

It samples the color at `white`, ignores the food at `plate`, and localizes the `salad`. Notice how it says `plate topped with` which are not words humans would use in this scenario, although it is technically correct. Must be all the pizza in the training data.

It identifies the objects correctly (the `kitten`'s actually a cat), but it says `playing` instead of eating. You can see why it would think this - kittens do tend to play with things, and the model doesn't have the same real word experience to guess that bananas are food more often than playthings.
